title: Apple Kids Category
---

[The Kids category](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/kids-apps/) on the App Store is a great way for people to easily find apps specifically designed for children ages 11 and under on iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.  
But the limits for advertising are too critical and only specialized ad networks for children, such as Kidoz and SuperAwesome, are allowed.  

CAS do not support a ready solution for Kids Category, but feel free to add Kidoz and SuperAwesome networks if you wish in `Advanced Integration` section.
