CAS.AI requires you to set flags indicating whether users are in an age-restricted category.

## Prohibition on Personal Information from Children
Publishers may designate all inventory within their applications as being child-directed or as COPPA-applicable though our UI. Publishers who have knowledge of specific individuals as being COPPA-applicable should make use of the API discussed below to inform CAS and all downstream consumers of this information.

### CASAudience.children
If you know that the user falls within an age-restricted category (i.e., under the age of 16), you must set the `children` audience flag:

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
    ```swift
    CAS.settings.taggedAudience = CASAudience.children
    ```

    ```objc
    CAS.settings.taggedAudience = CASAudienceChildren;
    ```
</CodeGroup>

It also allows application to comply with the Google Play Families Policy requirements:
 - Ads displayed to those users do not involve interest-based advertising or remarketing;
 - Ads displayed to those users present content that is appropriate for children;
 - Ads displayed to those users follow the Families ad format requirements;
 - Compliance with all applicable legal regulations and industry standards relating to advertising to children.
 
### CASAudience.notChildren
If you know that the user does not fall within an age-restricted category, you must set the `NotChildren` audience flag:

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
    ```swift
    CAS.settings.taggedAudience =  CASAudience.notChildren
    ```

    ```objc
    CAS.settings.taggedAudience = CASAudienceNotChildren;
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### CASAudience.undefined
The user's age has not been determined.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
    ```swift
    CAS.settings.taggedAudience = CASAudience.undefined
    ```

    ```objc
    CAS.settings.taggedAudience = CASAudienceUndefined;
    ```
</CodeGroup>

If your app's target age groups include both children and older audiences, any ads that may be shown to children must comply with Google Play's Families Ads Program.  
A neutral age screen must be implemented so that any ads not suitable for children are only shown to older audiences.  
A neutral age screen is a mechanism to verify a user's age in a way that doesn't encourage them to falsify their age and gain access to areas of your app that aren't designed for children, for example, an age gate.

## Apple Kids Category
[The Kids category](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/kids-apps/) on the App Store is a great way for people to easily find apps specifically designed for children ages 11 and under on iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.  
But the limits for advertising are too critical and only specialized ad networks for children, such as Kidoz and SuperAwesome, are allowed.  

CAS do not support a ready solution for Kids Category, but feel free to add Kidoz and SuperAwesome networks if you wish in `Advanced Integration` section.
