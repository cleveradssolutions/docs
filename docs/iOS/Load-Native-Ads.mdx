title: Load Native Ads
description: This guide explains how to integrate native ads into an iOS app.
---

Native ads are advertising assets seamlessly integrated into the user interface using components that are native to the platform.
They are displayed through the same views you use to construct your app's layouts, allowing for a cohesive user experience. 
Additionally, these ads can be customized to align with your app's visual design, ensuring they feel like a natural part of the content rather than intrusive advertisements.

Below is a diagram showing the ad lifecycle.

## Load Ad
Native ads are loaded with the `CASNativeLoader` class. A `CASNativeLoaderDelegate` for handling events related to native ad content.  
In most cases, a `casID` is the same as your application package name.

```swift
import CleverAdsSolutions

class MyViewController: UIViewController, CASNativeLoaderDelegate { 

    let adLoader = CASNativeLoader(casID: MyAppDelegate.casID)

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        loadNativeAds()
    }

    func loadNativeAds(){
        let loaderDelegate: CASNativeLoaderDelegate = self
        adLoader.delegate = loaderDelegate
        adLoader.adChoicesPlacement = AdChoicesPlacement.topRight // by default
        adLoader.isStartVideoMuted = true // by default
        adLoader.loadAd()
    }
    
    // MARK: - CASNativeLoaderDelegate
    
    func nativeAdDidLoadContent(_ ad: NativeAdContent) {
        receiveNativeAdContentEvents(ad)
        registerNativeAdContent(ad)  
    }

    func nativeAdDidFailToLoad(error: AdError) {
        // (Optional) Handle Ad load errors  
    }
}
```

After a call to `loadAd()`, a single callback is made to the previously defined `CASNativeLoaderDelegate` to deliver the native ad object or report an error.

### Autoload Ad mode
The `CASNativeLoader` does not have an autoload ad mode like other ad formats, so you need to implement error handling and ad reloading manually.

## Load multiple ads (optional)
The `load(maxNumberOfAds:)` method takes an additional parameter: the number of ads the SDK should attempt to load for the request. It's not guaranteed that the SDK will return the exact number of ads requested.
```kotlin
adLoader.load(maxNumberOfAds: 3)
```

The `nativeAdDidLoadContent(_:)` will be called multiple times, once for each ad that is successfully loaded, up to the specified maximum number of ads.  
If the load operation fails, the `nativeAdDidFailToLoad(error:)` will be called once with the error details.

Apps requesting multiple ads should call `CASNativeLoader.isLoading` in their callback implementations to determine whether the loading process has finished.
```swift
func nativeAdDidLoadContent(_ ad: NativeAdContent) {  
    receiveNativeAdContentEvents(ad)
    registerNativeAdContent(ad)
    
    if (adLoader.isAdLoading) {
        // The AdLoader is still loading ads.
        // Expect more nativeAdDidLoadContent(_:) 
        // or nativeAdDidFailToLoad(error:) callbacks.
    } else {
        // The AdLoader has finished loading ads.
    }   
} 
```

## Receive Ad events
To be notified of events related to the native ad interactions, set the delegate property of the native ad and then implement `CASNativeContentDelegate` to receive the following delegate calls:

```swift
class AppController: UIViewController, CASNativeContentDelegate, CASNativeLoaderDelegate { 

    func receiveNativeAdContentEvents(_ nativeAd: NativeAdContent) {
        let adInfo: AdContentInfo = netiveAd.adInfo
        
        let nativeAdDelegate: CASNativeContentDelegate = self
        nativeAd.delegate = nativeAdDelegate
    }

    // MARK: - CASNativeContentDelegate
    
    func nativeAd(_ ad: NativeAdContent, didFailToPresentWithError error: AdError) {
        // (Optional) Handle Ad render errors. 
        // Called from CASNativeView.setNativeAd(nativeAd)  
    }

    func nativeAdDidClickContent(_ ad: NativeAdContent) {
        // (Optional) Called when the native ad is clicked by the user.  
    }
}
```

Don't implement any custom click handlers on any views over or within the native ad view. To observe click events yourself, use the ad delegate `nativeAdDidClickContent(_:)`. Clicks on the ad view assets are handled by the SDK as long as you correctly populate and register the asset views, as discussed in the previous section.
