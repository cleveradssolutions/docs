title: Targeting options
---

You can now easily tailor the way you serve your ads to fit a specific audience!  
You’ll need to inform our servers of the users’ details so the SDK will know to serve ads according
to the segment the user belongs to.

### User ID
The userID is a unique identifier supplied by your application and must be static for each user across sessions. 

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```swift
CAS.getTargetingOptions().setUserID("user-hash-code");
```

```objc
[[CAS targetingOptions] setUserID:@"user-hash-code"];
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>  
Your userID should not contain any personally identifiable information such as  an email address, screen name, IDFV (identifier for vendor) or IDFA (Apple’s Advertising Identifier).
</Warning>

## User Age
Set user age. Limitation: 1-99. By default 0 is 'unknown'.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```swift
CAS.targetingOptions.age = 12
```

```objc
[CAS targetingOptions].age = 12;
```
</CodeGroup>

## User Gender
Set user gender.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```swift
CAS.targetingOptions.gender = Gender.male
```

```objc
[CAS targetingOptions].gender = CASGenderMale;
```
</CodeGroup>

## User Location
Set the user's current location. Location data is not used to CAS; however, it may be used by third party ad networks.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```swift
CAS.targetingOptions.setLocation(latitude: userLatitude, longitude: userLongitude)
```

```objc
[[CAS targetingOptions] setLocationWithLatitude:userLatitude longitude:userLongitude];
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>  
Do not use Location just for advertising. Your app should have a valid use case for it as well.
</Warning>

### User Location auto collection
Collect from the device the latitude and longitude coordinated truncated to the hundredths decimal place. 
- Collect only if your application already has the relevant end-user permissions.  
* Does not collect if the target audience is children.   
* Disabled by default.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```swift
CAS.targetingOptions.locationCollectionEnabled = true
```

```objc
[CAS targetingOptions].locationCollectionEnabled = YES;
```
</CodeGroup>

## App Keywords
Set a list of keywords, interests, or intents related to your application. Words or phrases describe
the current activity of the user for targeting purposes.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```swift
CAS.targetingOptions.keywords = keywords
```

```objc
[CAS targetingOptions].keywords = keywords;
```
</CodeGroup>

## App Content URL
Set the content URL for a website whose content matches the app's primary content. This website content is used for targeting and brand safety purposes. Limitation: max URL length 512.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```swift
CAS.targetingOptions.contentUrl = contentUrl
```

```objc
[CAS targetingOptions].contentUrl = contentUrl;
```
</CodeGroup>
