title: Interstitial Ads
description: This guide explains how to integrate interstitial ads into a ReactNative app.
---

Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the interface of their host app.
They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between screens.
When an app shows an interstitial ad, the user has the choice to either tap on the ad and continue to its destination or close it and return to the app.

Interstitial Ad management in React code is handled through the `InterstitialAd` class from `react-native-cas`,
which extends the shared fullscreen ad logic.
The interstitial ad is displayed as an overlay on top of all app content and cannot be added to the ReactNative component tree.

CAS provides an option to enable `autoReload` to simplify your app logic. Before using the ad, you should decide whether to enable `autoReload`, or manually manage each ad loading cycle in your code.
When `autoReload` is enabled, a new ad will be automatically loaded after each display, and loading failures will trigger automatic retry attempts.

```ts
const isAutoReloadEnabled = true;
```

Manual load mode (`autoReload: false`) is useful when you only need to show a single ad per app screen, and the screens change frequently.
Below is a diagram showing the ad lifecycle and how `autoReload` (isAutoload) affects it.

## Create Ad instance
The following example creates and loads an interstitial ad:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  InterstitialAd.setAutoloadEnabled(true);
}, []);

```

Ad content may take some time to load after creating an ad instance.
To ensure the ad displays instantly when needed, create the ad instance in advance.
Use the `addAdLoadedEventListener` event to be notified when the ad is ready for display.

---

## Ad content callbacks
`InterstitialAd` provides multiple lifecycle callbacks, which can be registered via event listeners or `setCallbacks()`.

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribeLoaded = InterstitialAd.addAdLoadedEventListener(() => console.log('Loaded'));
  const unsubscribeLoadFailed = InterstitialAd.addAdLoadFailedEventListener((err) => console.log('Load failed:', err));
  const unsubscribeShowed = InterstitialAd.addAdShowedEventListener(() => console.log('Showed'));
  const unsubscribeFailedToShow = InterstitialAd.addAdFailedToShowEventListener((err) => console.log('Failed to show:', err));
  const unsubscribeClicked = InterstitialAd.addAdClickedEventListener(() => console.log('Clicked'));
  const unsubscribeDismissed = InterstitialAd.addAdDismissedEventListener(() => console.log('Dismissed'));
  const unsubscribeImpression = InterstitialAd.addAdImpressionEventListener((imp) => console.log('Impression', imp));

  return () => {
    unsubscribeLoaded();
    unsubscribeLoadFailed();
    unsubscribeShowed();
    unsubscribeFailedToShow();
    unsubscribeClicked();
    unsubscribeDismissed();
    unsubscribeImpression();
    InterstitialAd.destroy();
  };
}, []);

```

<Info>
- Read more about `AdContentInfo` structure in [Impression Level Data](ReactNative/Impression-Level-Data).  
- When an error occurs during ad impression, only `onAdFailedToShow` is executed.  
  In this case, `onAdDismissed` will not be called since the impression is not considered successful.

## Show Ad
Interstitial ads should be displayed during natural pauses in your app flow — for example, between screens or after a task completes.
Show an ad by calling:

```ts
import { InterstitialAd } from 'react-native-cas';
InterstitialAd.showAd();
```

If the ad is not ready at that moment, `onAdFailedToShow` will be triggered.
You can check beforehand:

```ts
const isLoaded = InterstitialAd.isAdLoaded();
if (isLoaded) InterstitialAd.showAd();
```

---

### Auto Show Ad mode
CAS provides the option to automatically show a loaded ad when the user returns to the app.
To enable this behavior:

```ts
import { InterstitialAd } from 'react-native-cas';

InterstitialAd.setAutoshowEnabled(true); // [!code highlight]
InterstitialAd.loadAd();
```

---

## Release ad resource
Be sure to release ad resources if you’re no longer going to use the ad instance.

```ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { InterstitialAd } from 'react-native-cas';

useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    InterstitialAd.destroy();
  };
}, []);
```

It may be useful to keep a global interstitial instance to reuse across multiple screens.
This way, you can display an already loaded ad instantly without delay.

---

## Manual reload Ad
When you want to manually control ad loading, call:

```ts
import { InterstitialAd } from 'react-native-cas';
InterstitialAd.loadAd();
```

---

## Minimum interval between impressions
The minimum interval between showing interstitial ads (in seconds).
If another ad is shown before the interval passes, `onAdFailedToShow` will trigger with `AdError.codeNotPassedInterval`.

```ts
import { InterstitialAd } from 'react-native-cas';
InterstitialAd.setMinInterval(0); // [!code highlight]
```

The interval timer is shared across all interstitial ad instances.
You can reset it manually, e.g., after showing a Rewarded or AppOpen ad:

```ts
InterstitialAd.restartInterval();
```

---

## Mute Ad sounds
You can mute fullscreen ad sounds if your app manages its own audio:

```ts
import { CASMobileAds } from 'react-native-cas';
CASMobileAds.setAdSoundsMuted(true);
```

Not muted by default.

## Some best practices

#### Consider whether interstitial ads are the right type of ad for your app.
Interstitial ads work best in apps with natural transition points.
Display them when a task finishes or the user expects a short pause.

#### Remember to pause the action when displaying an interstitial ad.
Pause any ongoing app activity (e.g., audio) when an interstitial ad is showing.

#### Allow for adequate loading time.
Load the ad in advance by calling `loadAd()` before `showAd()` so it’s instantly available.

#### Don't flood the user with ads.
Avoid excessive frequency — too many interruptions degrade user experience and lower engagement.
