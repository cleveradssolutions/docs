title: Rewarded Ads
description: This guide explains how to integrate rewarded ads into a ReactNative app.
---

Rewarded ads let you offer users in-app items, such as continued gameplay, virtual currency, or other rewards, in exchange for their engagement with ads.
Rewarded ads boost engagement because users receive a tangible benefit for their time.

Rewarded Ad management in React code is handled through the `RewardedAd` class from `react-native-cas`,
which extends the shared fullscreen ad logic.
The rewarded ad is displayed as an overlay on top of all app content and cannot be added to the ReactNative component tree.

CAS provides an option to enable `autoReload` to simplify your app logic.
Before using the ad, you should decide whether to enable `autoReload`, or manually manage each ad loading cycle in your code.
When `autoReload` is enabled, a new ad will be automatically loaded after each display, and loading failures will trigger automatic retry attempts.

```ts
const isAutoReloadEnabled = true;
```

Manual load mode (`autoReload: false`) is useful when you only need to show a single ad per app screen, and the screens change frequently.
Below is a diagram showing the ad lifecycle and how `autoReload` (isAutoload) affects it.

## Create Ad instance
The following example creates and loads a rewarded video ad:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  RewardedAd.setAutoloadEnabled(true);
}, []);

```

Ad content may take some time to load after creating an ad instance.
To ensure the ad displays instantly when needed, create the ad instance in advance.
Use the `addAdLoadedEventListener` event to be notified when the ad is ready for display.
CAS can preload multiple rewarded ads in advance for smoother delivery.

---

## Ad content callbacks
`RewardedAd` provides several lifecycle event listeners to handle ad behavior:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribeLoaded = RewardedAd.addAdLoadedEventListener(() => console.log('Loaded'));
  const unsubscribeLoadFailed = RewardedAd.addAdLoadFailedEventListener((err) => console.log('Load failed:', err));
  const unsubscribeShowed = RewardedAd.addAdShowedEventListener(() => console.log('Showed'));
  const unsubscribeFailedToShow = RewardedAd.addAdFailedToShowEventListener((err) => console.log('Failed to show:', err));
  const unsubscribeClicked = RewardedAd.addAdClickedEventListener(() => console.log('Clicked'));
  const unsubscribeDismissed = RewardedAd.addAdDismissedEventListener(() => console.log('Dismissed'));
  const unsubscribeImpression = RewardedAd.addAdImpressionEventListener((imp) => console.log('Impression', imp));
  const unsubscribeReward = RewardedAd.addAdUserEarnRewardEventListener(() => console.log('User earned reward'));

  return () => {
    unsubscribeLoaded();
    unsubscribeLoadFailed();
    unsubscribeShowed();
    unsubscribeFailedToShow();
    unsubscribeClicked();
    unsubscribeDismissed();
    unsubscribeImpression();
    unsubscribeReward();
    RewardedAd.destroy();
  };
}, []);

```

<Info>
- Read more about `AdContentInfo` structure in [Impression Level Data](ReactNative/Impression-Level-Data).  
- When an error occurs during ad impression, only `onAdFailedToShow` is triggered.  
  In this case, `onAdDismissed` will not be executed since the impression is not considered successful.
</Info>

## Show Ad
Be sure to handle the `onUserEarnedReward` event to grant rewards to users after watching an ad.

```ts
RewardedAd.addAdUserEarnRewardEventListener(() => {
  console.log('Reward the user for watching the ad');
});

RewardedAd.showAd();
```

The `onUserEarnedReward` callback differs from `onAdDismissed` â€” the user might not complete the ad and thus not earn a reward.
If the ad is not ready, `onAdFailedToShow` will trigger.
You can check readiness before showing:

```ts
const isAdLoaded = RewardedAd.isAdLoaded();
if (isAdLoaded) {
  RewardedAd.showAd();
}
```

---

## Release ad resource
Be sure to release ad resources when no longer needed:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    RewardedAd.destroy();
  };
}, []);
```

Keeping a global rewarded ad instance helps reuse it across screens without delays.

---

## Manual reload Ad
To manually reload an ad, call:

```ts
RewardedAd.loadAd();
```

---

## Extra fill by Interstitial Ad
CAS allows using interstitial ads as fallback fill when rewarded ads are unavailable.
`onUserEarnedReward` will still trigger as if the user completed a rewarded ad.

```ts
RewardedAd.setExtraFillByInterstitialAd(true); // [!code highlight]
RewardedAd.loadAd();
```

---

## Mute Ad sounds
You can mute ad sounds if your app controls its own audio:

```ts
import { CASMobileAds } from 'react-native-cas';
CASMobileAds.setAdSoundsMuted(true);
```

Not muted by default.
