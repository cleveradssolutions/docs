title: App Open Ads
description: This guide explains how to integrate app open ads into a React Native app.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

App open ads are a special ad format intended for publishers wishing to monetize their app load screens.
App open ads can be closed at any time, and are designed to be shown when your users bring your app to the foreground.
App open ads automatically show a small branding area so users know they're in your app.

AppOpen ad management in React Native is handled through the `AppOpenAd` module from **react-native-cas**.
It displays as a fullscreen overlay and cannot be added to the React component tree.

CAS provides an option to enable `autoReload` to simplify your app logic.
Before using the ad, decide whether to enable `autoReload`, or manually manage each ad loading cycle in your code.

When `autoReload` is enabled, a new ad will be automatically loaded after each display, and loading failures will trigger automatic retry attempts.

```ts
const isAutoReloadEnabled = true as const;
````

Manual load mode (`isAutoReloadEnabled = false`) is useful when you only need to show a single ad per screen and screens change frequently.

Below is a diagram showing the ad lifecycle and how `autoReload` affects it.

## Create Ad instance
The following example creates and loads an app open ad:

```ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { AppOpenAd } from 'react-native-cas';

useEffect(() => {
  AppOpenAd.setAutoloadEnabled(true);
  AppOpenAd.loadAd();
}, []);
```

Ad content may take some time to load after calling `loadAd()`.
To ensure the ad displays instantly when needed, preload it early.
Use event listeners to know when it’s ready.

CAS can preload multiple ad instances in advance to ensure uninterrupted delivery.

## Ad content callbacks
`AppOpenAd` provides several optional event listeners for the ad lifecycle.

```ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { AppOpenAd } from 'react-native-cas';

useEffect(() => {
  const offLoaded = AppOpenAd.addAdLoadedEventListener(() => console.log('AppOpen loaded'));
  const offLoadFailed = AppOpenAd.addAdLoadFailedEventListener((err) => console.log('Load failed:', err));
  const offShowed = AppOpenAd.addAdShowedEventListener(() => console.log('Ad showed'));
  const offFailedToShow = AppOpenAd.addAdFailedToShowEventListener((err) => console.log('Failed to show:', err));
  const offDismissed = AppOpenAd.addAdDismissedEventListener(() => console.log('Ad dismissed'));
  const offClicked = AppOpenAd.addAdClickedEventListener(() => console.log('Ad clicked'));
  const offImpression = AppOpenAd.addAdImpressionEventListener((imp) => console.log('Ad impression', imp));

  return () => {
    offLoaded();
    offLoadFailed();
    offShowed();
    offFailedToShow();
    offDismissed();
    offClicked();
    offImpression();
    AppOpenAd.destroy?.();
  };
}, []);
```

<Info>
- Read more about `AdContentInfo` structure in [Impression Level Data](ReactNative/Impression-Level-Data).
- When an error occurs during ad impression, only `onFailedToShow` is triggered.  
  In this case, `onDismissed` will not be executed since the impression is not considered successful.

## Show Ad
App open ads help monetize your app's loading screen during launch or app switches.
Best practices:

- Show your first app open ad after users have opened the app a few times.
- Show ads only during natural waiting periods (e.g., app load).
- Avoid showing another app open ad immediately after returning from a previous one.

Show an ad by calling:

```ts
await AppOpenAd.showAd();
```

If the ad is not ready, the `onAdFailedToShow` event will trigger with an error reason.

Optionally, you can check if the ad is loaded:

```ts
const isAdLoaded = await AppOpenAd.isAdLoaded();
```

### Auto Show mode
CAS provides the option to automatically show a loaded ad when the user returns to the app.
To enable this behavior, call:

```ts
await AppOpenAd.setAutoshowEnabled(true);
await AppOpenAd.loadAd();
```

## Release ad resource
Release ad resources when no longer needed.

```ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { AppOpenAd } from 'react-native-cas';

useEffect(() => {
  const offDismissed = AppOpenAd.addAdDismissedEventListener(() => console.log('Dismissed'));

  return () => {
    offDismissed();
    AppOpenAd.destroy?.();
  };
}, []);
```

You may also keep the ad instance preloaded globally to reuse across screens and avoid reloading delays.

## Manual reload Ad
When manually managing ads, call `loadAd()` again to retry:

```ts
await AppOpenAd.loadAd();
```

## Mute Ad sounds
Mute fullscreen ad sounds if your app has its own audio controls.

```ts
import { CASMobileAds } from 'react-native-cas';
CASMobileAds.setAdSoundsMuted(true);
```

Not muted by default.

## Cold starts and Loading screens
There is a delay between requesting and receiving an ad.
Avoid showing app content briefly before the ad — use a loading screen first, and show the ad after that.
If your app already shows content after the loading screen, do not show an app open ad.

## Best Practices
- Load the app open ad first on cold start.
  Load other formats (banner, interstitial, rewarded) afterward to avoid parallel loading.
- If a loading screen finishes before the ad is dismissed, hide it in `onAdDismissed` or `onAdFailedToShow`.
- Wait a few days after install before showing cold-start ads.
- Show ads only if the app was backgrounded for a certain time (e.g., 30 seconds).
- After showing a cold-start ad, wait before showing other fullscreen ads.
- Optionally, inform users that an ad will appear during loading (e.g., “Watch an ad while the app loads.”).
