title: Ad errors
---

When an ad fails to **load** or **show**, the SDK triggers a callback providing an `AdError` object.

`AdError` is commonly used in ad-related callbacks such as `onAdFailedToLoad` or `onAdFailedToShow`.

Use **`AdError.code`** to retrieve the error code.  
Use **`AdError.message`** to get a human-readable description.

See below for all available error code constants:

---

<Property name="codeInternalError">
  **Code:** `0`  
  Indicates an internal error occurred within the SDK.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeNotReady" code="1">
  Indicates that ads are not yet ready to be shown.  
  Ensure you have called the appropriate ad loading method or enabled automatic load mode.  
  If using automatic loading, wait slightly longer for the ad to become ready.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeRejected" code="2">
  Indicates that the device is rejected for ad services.  
  Services may be unavailable for devices that do not meet regional or OS requirements.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeNoFill" code="3">
  Indicates that no ads are currently available to be served.  
  If ads appear in test mode, your integration is correct and live ads will resume once inventory is available.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeReachedCap" code="6">
  Indicates that the ad creative has reached its daily serving cap for this user.  
  This typically applies to cross-promotion ads only.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeNotInitialized" code="7">
  Indicates that the CAS SDK has not been initialized.  
  Ensure proper initialization before loading or showing ads.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeTimeout" code="8">
  Indicates a timeout occurred because an ad source did not respond in time.  
  The system will continue waiting for a response, which may delay or fail ad loading.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeNoConnection" code="9">
  Indicates that there is no active internet connection, preventing ad requests.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeConfigurationError" code="10">

  Report this issue to your CAS support manager for further assistance.
</Property>

<Property name="codeNotPassedInterval" code="11">
  Indicates that the minimum interval between fullscreen ad impressions has not passed yet.  
  This may also occur when a trial ad-free interval is active and has not expired since app start.
</Property>

---

<Property name="codeAlreadyDisplayed" code="12">
  Indicates that another fullscreen ad is currently being displayed,  
  preventing new ads from showing. Review your ad display logic to avoid overlap.
</Property>
