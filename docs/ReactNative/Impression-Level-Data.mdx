title: Impression Level Data
---
CAS.AI SDK provides detailed impression-level data via callbacks, including which demand source served the ad and the exact/estimated revenue. Use this to analyze and optimize monetization and UA strategies.

### AdContentInfo
`AdContentInfo` contains information about a loaded/displayed ad. In React Native, you receive it from impression events:

```ts
const unsubscribe = AppOpenAd.addAdImpressionEventListener((info) => {
  console.log('AppOpen impression', info);
});
```

| Name               | Type      | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sourceName`       | `string`  | Display name of the mediated network that purchased the impression.                                           |
| `sourceUnitId`     | `string`  | Ad Unit ID from the mediated network.                                                                         |
| `creativeId`       | `string?` | Creative ID, if available (useful for reporting creative issues).                                             |
| `revenue`          | `number`  | Revenue generated from this impression, in USD (may be estimated or precise depending on `revenuePrecision`). |
| `revenuePrecision` | `string`  | Precision type of `revenue` (e.g., `estimated`, `precise`).                                                   |
| `revenueTotal`     | `number`  | Accumulated user ad revenue in USD across all ad formats.                                                     |
| `impressionDepth`  | `number`  | Total number of impressions for the current user across all sessions.                                         |

#### AdContentInfo fields (as properties)
<Property name="format" type="string" required>
  Ad format (e.g., `Banner`, `MREC`, `Interstitial`, `Rewarded`, `AppOpen`).
</Property>

---

<Property name="revenue" type="number" required>
  Impression revenue in USD.
</Property>

---

<Property name="revenuePrecision" type="string" required>
  Revenue precision, usually `estimated` or `precise` depending on the network.
</Property>

---

<Property name="sourceName" type="string" required>
  Ad network name that won the impression.
</Property>

---

<Property name="sourceUnitId" type="string" required>
  The network’s ad unit id that served this impression.
</Property>

---

<Property name="creativeId" type="string" optional>
  Creative identifier, if available.
</Property>

---

<Property name="revenueTotal" type="number" required>
  Accumulated user revenue across formats (per SDK tracking).
</Property>

---

<Property name="impressionDepth" type="number" required>
  Total impressions count for the current user.
</Property>

### Ad Impression callback
Each ad format exposes an impression callback:

```ts
import { AppOpenAd, InterstitialAd, RewardedAd } from 'react-native-cas';

function setAdImpressionCallbacks() {
  const unAppOpen = AppOpenAd.addAdImpressionEventListener(onAdImpression);
  const unInterstitial = InterstitialAd.addAdImpressionEventListener(onAdImpression);
  const unRewarded = RewardedAd.addAdImpressionEventListener(onAdImpression);
}

function onAdImpression(impression /* AdContentInfo */) {
  const adPlatform = 'CAS';
  const adFormat = impression.format;
  const adSource = impression.sourceName;
  const adUnitName = impression.sourceUnitId;
  const value = impression.revenue;
  const currency = 'USD';
}
```

For banners, pass a prop on the React component:

```tsx
<BannerAdView onAdViewImpression={(info) => onAdImpression(info)} />
```

### User ad summary
The SDK tracks cumulative impressions and revenue; they are included in each impression payload:

```ts
const totalImpressions = impression.impressionDepth;
const totalRevenue = impression.revenueTotal;
```

<Info>
Progress is saved between sessions until the user clears your app data.
</Info>

## Automatic collection to analytics
CAS can automatically collect ad revenue to Google Analytics and Tenjin. Contact your account manager to enable these events.

### Google Analytics
1. Set up your project & app as in **Get Started with Analytics**.
2. Link your Firebase project to a Google Analytics account.
3. Use CAS SDK **3.5.0+**.

The SDK logs `ad_impression` events whenever an ad is shown. These include platform, source, currency, and value.

### Tenjin
1. Set up your project & app as in **Tenjin Android SDK – Basic integration**.
2. Ensure a Tenjin session is initialized, or pass the key via CAS init so CAS initializes Tenjin automatically:
```ts
import { CASMobileAds } from 'react-native-cas';

CASMobileAds.initialize('your_cas_id', {
  mediationExtras: { tenjin_key: TENJIN_SDK_KEY },
});
```
3. Use CAS SDK **3.7.2+**.
