title: Building Unreal Engine 4 with XCode 14
---

In order to implement CAS plugin and package project for iOS, you will need XCode 14. Unreal Engine 4 does not support XCode 14 by default, so you must do some changes to its code.

## Download sources

First, you will need Unreal Engine from GitHub. To finish this step, please, refer to official documentation: 

https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/DownloadingSourceCode/

> Make sure you clone needed version of UE4 from certain tag, not from a main/master branch. 
> 
> For example `git clone --depth 1 --branch 4.27.2-release git@github.com:EpicGames/UnrealEngine.git`

## Fix Unreal Engine 4 for XCode 14

Unreal Engine 4 generates XCode project by its build system. XCode project gets generates with some options missing. We need to add those in order to make UE4 compile successfully.

In files 

1) Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Platform/Mac/MacToolChain.cs
2) Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Platform/IOS/IOSToolChain.cs

Add following lines in function `GetCompileArguments_Global`:

```cs
// Add after line 
// Result += " -Wall -Werror"; 
// next lines

Result += " -Wno-unused-but-set-variable";
Result += " -Wno-uninitialized-const-reference";
Result += " -Wno-ordered-compare-function-pointers";
```


You will also need to do a little fix in `Engine/Source/ThirdParty/libWebSockets/libwebsockets/include/Mac/libwebsockets.h`.

```cpp
// Replace line
enum http_status {
//With
enum class http_status {
```
