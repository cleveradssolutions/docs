title: Include Android
---

## Disable Unreal Engine's built-in AdMob support
The CAS plugin automatically performs all configurations for AdMob in mediation integration.  

Navigate to the `Editor > Project Settings > Platform > Android > Google Play Services` section and disable the option:
 - [ ] Include AdMob support for ads

Additionally, use the advertising management functions from CAS Mobile Ads, not the built-in functions for AdMob. 

<Warning>  
Be cautious, as some Blueprint Nodes have identical names: `Show Interstitial Ad`, `Show Ad Banner`.  
You should exclusively use nodes from the CAS Mobile Ads category.
</Warning>

## Upgrade the Gradle wrapper
To select the Gradle version, navigate to the directory for your version of the Unreal Engine and follow the file path.
```
Engine/Build/Android/Java/gradle/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
```
Change the `distributionUrl` property to the desired version.
```
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.7.1-all.zip
```

<Info>
If your UE is already using a newer version of Gradle than 6.7.1, you don't need to do anything further. The Android Gradle plugin version will also be at least 4.2.2.
</Info>

## Upgrade the Android Gradle plugin
To select the Android Gradle plugin version, navigate to the directory for your version of the Unreal Engine and follow the file path.
```
Engine/Build/Android/Java/gradle/build.gradle
```
Change the line with `com.android.tools.build:gradle` to the desired version.
```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories { ... }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.2'
    }
    ...
}
```

## Unreal Engine 4 compatibility for API 34
The AppCache API is no longer supported, so its use must be removed from the engine java script.  

Navigate to the directory for your version of the Unreal Engine and follow the file path.
```
Engine/Build/Android/Java/src/com/epicgames/ue4/WebViewControl.java
```
Remove (comment) the following lines of code:
```java
viewer.getSettings().setAppCacheMaxSize(1024*1024*8);
viewer.getSettings().setAppCachePath("/data/data/com.your.package.appname/cache"‌​);
viewer.getSettings().setAppCacheEnabled(true);
```

## Unreal Engine 4 compatibility for API 32
Applications which has an activity, activity alias, service or broadcast receiver with intent filter, must explicitly declare the `android:exported` attribute.  

Navigate to the `Editor > Project Settings > Platform > Android > Advanced APK Packaging` section and add `Extra Tags for UE4 GameActivity <activity> node`:
```
android:exported="true"
```
