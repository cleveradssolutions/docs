title: Impression Level Data
---

CAS.AI enables you to access detailed information for each impression through the impressions callback APIs. The information includes, for example, which demand source served the ad, the expected or exact revenue associated with it. In addition, it contains granular details to allow you to analyze and, ultimately, optimize user acquisition strategies. 

## Ad Impression
`FCASImpressionInfo` is an struct for getting detailed information about the current ad impression, such as revenue and ad creative details.  

```cpp

UCASMobileAds::OnAdsImpression.AddLambda([=](const FCASImpressionInfo& info){
    // Get ad details using info parameter
});
```

### Ad revenue
The revenue generated for the 1000 impressions in USD. 
```cpp
float cpm = info.RevenueCPM;
```

### Ad creative
You can also retrieve information about the current ad (such as its mediated network and creative ID), and you will be able to report creative issues for that ad to our Ad review team.
```cpp
FString PlacementType = info.PlacementType;
FString CreativeId = info.CreativeID;
FString NetworkName = info.Network;
FString NetworkUnitId = info.UnitID;
```
### User ad summary 
CAS count the number of ad impressions and the total revenue of all formats at the time of a new impression. 
```cpp
int totalImpressions = info.TotalImpressions;
float totalRevenue = info.LifetimeRevenue;
```

<Info>
Progress is saved between sessions until the user clears your app's data.
