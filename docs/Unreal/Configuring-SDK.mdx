</Info>

## CAS App ID
In most cases, a CAS App Id is the same as the Android App's package name, and the iOS App's store Id.
- A [package name](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id) uniquely identifies your app on the device and in the Google Play Store.
- The store ID of an iOS app uniquely identifies your app in the Apple App Store.
- You can find an app's store ID in the URL of your appâ€™s Apple App Store listing. For example, the URL of an app page is `apps.apple.com/us/app/id123456789`. The app's store ID is `123456789`.
-  If you haven't created an CAS account and registered an app yet, now's a great time to do so at [CAS.ai](https://cas.ai). 
- In a real app, it is important that you use your actual CAS App ID.  

## Autoload ad formats
Select the advertisement formats that will be loaded automatically after the ads initialization. The chosen ad formats will also be automatically loaded after being displayed or encountering a loading error. In this case, you may choose not to use the ad loading functions and instead simply call the ad display functions when needed. The ad will be displayed if it is ready; otherwise, a failure event will be triggered.

## Use Advertising Id
The Advertising ID is a unique, user-resettable ID for advertising, provided by Google Play services ([AD_ID](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en)) or by Apple ([IDFA](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/advertisingidentifier)). Crucial for mobile attribution, i.e. tracking the user journey, its purpose is to measure user interactions with ad campaigns and track events like installs and in-app activity.
- [x] Use Advertising Id

## User Tracking Usage Description (iOS Only)
If your app calls the App Tracking Transparency API, you must provide custom text, known as a _usage-description string_, which displays as a system-permission alert request. The usage-description string tells the user why the app is requesting permission to use data for tracking the user or the device. The user has the option to grant or deny the authorization request.

- Allowed if used Advertising Id property only.

## Privacy Policy URL
Provide a link to the app's Privacy Policy so that it is presented to the user in the consent dialog.

If you don't define a link to your application's policy, the user will follow the link to [Clever Ads Solutions policy](https://cas.ai/privacy-policy-3/).

## Cross-promotion
Cross-promotion is an app marketing strategy in which app developers promote one of their titles on another one of their titles. Cross promoting is especially effective for developers with large portfolios of games as a means to move users across titles and use the opportunity to scale each of their apps. This is most commonly used by hyper-casual publishers who have relatively low retention, and use cross promotion to keep users within their app portfolio.  

Start your cross promotion campaign with https://cas.ai.  

<Info>
CrossPromotion can be installed/removed using `Mediation/Advanced` section.
