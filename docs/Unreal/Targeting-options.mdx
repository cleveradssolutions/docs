title: Targeting options
---

You can now easily tailor the way you serve your ads to fit a specific audience!  
You’ll need to inform our servers of the users’ details so the SDK will know to serve ads according
to the segment the user belongs to.

## User Id
The userID is a unique identifier supplied by your application and must be static for each user across sessions. 
```cpp
UCASMobileAds::SetUserIDForAds(SomeStringWithID);
```

<Warning>  
Your userID should not contain any personally identifiable information such as  an email address, screen name, Android ID (AID), Apple Advertising ID (IDFA), or Google Advertising ID (GAID).
</Warning>

## User Age

Set user age. Limitation: 1-99 and 0 is 'unknown'.

```cpp
UCASMobileAds::SetUserAgeForAds(12);
```

## User Gender

Set user gender.

```cpp
UCASMobileAds::SetUserGenderForAds(ECASGender::Male);
```
