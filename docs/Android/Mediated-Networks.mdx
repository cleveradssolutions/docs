title: Mediated Networks
description: This guide shows the ad sources CAS.AI Mediation supports.
---

Advanced publishers who are familiar with ad network integrations can choose their own set of adapters. If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact your account manager.  

Feel free not to use ready-made (`Optimal` or `Families`) solutions, and choose which mediated ad networks you want to integrate by copy following adapter names to `build.gradle` file: 

Just specify `true` for the adapters you want to use and all the necessary dependencies will be included in your application automatically.

```groovy
cas {  
    adapters {  
        ironSource = true  
        googleAds = true  
        unityAds = true  
        liftoffMonetize = true  
        chartboost = true  
        dtExchange = true  
        inMobi = true  
        kidoz = true    
        mintegral = true  
        appLovin = true  
        audienceNetwork = true  
        pangle = true  
        yandexAds = true  
        bigoAds = true  
        casExchange = true
        ysoNetwork = true
        ogury = true
        startIO = true  
        hyprMX = true  
    }  
}
```

    adapters {
        prado = true
        maticoo = true
        madex = true

## Cross promotion adapter
Cross promotion is an app marketing strategy in which app developers promote one of their titles on another one of their titles. Cross promoting is especially effective for developers with large portfolios of games as a means to move users across titles and use the opportunity to scale each of their apps. This is most commonly used by hyper-casual publishers who have relatively low retention, and use cross promotion to keep users within their app portfolio.

```groovy
cas {  
    adapters {  
        crossPromo = true  
    }  
}
```

Contact our account manager if you are interested in cross-promotion.
