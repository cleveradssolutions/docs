title: Rewarded Ads
description: This guide explains how to integrate rewarded video ads into an Android app.
---

Rewarded ads let you offer users in-app items, such as continued gameplay, virtual currency, or other rewards, in exchange for their engagement with ads. 
Rewarded ads boost engagement because users receive a tangible benefit for their time.

Below is a diagram showing the ad lifecycle.

## Create Ad instance
Ad instance can be initialized along with the activity before `onCreate`.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
import com.cleveradssolutions.sdk.screen.CASRewarded

class MyActivity : Activity() {

    private val rewardedAd = CASRewarded(MyApplication.CAS_ID)

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        ...
    }
}
```

```java
import com.cleveradssolutions.sdk.screen.CASRewarded;

class MyActivity extends Activity {

    final CASRewarded rewardedAd = new CASRewarded(MyApplication.CAS_ID);

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        ...
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The SDK provides the capability to create and precache multiple ad instances, enabling uninterrupted sequential ad display. CAS SDK will load mediation ads in order for each created instance.

## Create Ad Content callback

The `com.cleveradssolutions.sdk.screen.ScreenAdContentCallback` handles events related to displaying your `CASRewarded`. Callbacks are called on the main thread. Before showing ad, make sure to set `contentCallback`.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
val adContentCallback = object : ScreenAdContentCallback {
    override fun onAdLoaded(ad: AdContentInfo) {
    // (Optional) Called when the ad content has been successfully loaded.
    }


    override fun onAdFailedToLoad(format: AdFormat, error: AdError) {
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content fails to load.
    }

    override fun onAdFailedToShow(format: AdFormat, error: AdError) {
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content fails to show.
    }

    override fun onAdShowed(ad: AdContentInfo) {
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content is successfully shown.
    }

    override fun onAdClicked(ad: AdContentInfo) {
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content is clicked by the user.
    }

    override fun onAdDismissed(ad: AdContentInfo) {
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content is dismissed.
    }
}
```

```java
final ScreenAdContentCallback adContentCallback = new ScreenAdContentCallback() {  
    @Override  
    public void onAdLoaded(@NonNull AdContentInfo ad) {  
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content has been successfully loaded.  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public void onAdFailedToLoad(@NonNull AdFormat format, @NonNull AdError error) {  
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content fails to load.  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public void onAdFailedToShow(@NonNull AdFormat format, @NonNull AdError error) {  
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content fails to show.  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public void onAdShowed(@NonNull AdContentInfo ad) {  
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content is successfully shown.  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public void onAdClicked(@NonNull AdContentInfo ad) {  
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content is clicked by the user.  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public void onAdDismissed(@NonNull AdContentInfo ad) {  
        // (Optional) Called when the ad content is dismissed.  
    }  
};
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
- Read more about `AdContentInfo` structure in [Impression Level Data](Android/Impression-Level-Data).
- Attempting to load a new ad from the `onAdFailedToLoad()` method is strongly discouraged. Limit ad load retries to avoid continuous failed ad requests in situations such as limited network connectivity.
- When an error occurs during ad impression, executed the `onAdFailedToShow` only. In this case the `onAdDismissed` will not be executed, since the impression is not considered successful.
</Info>

## Load Ad

The next step is to fill out the `load()` method and handle the ad load callbacks. 

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

    rewardedAd.contentCallback = adContentCallback
    rewardedAd.load(this)
}
```

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    rewardedAd.setContentCallback(adContentCallback);
    rewardedAd.load(this);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

You can use ad load calls to build up a cache of preloaded ads before you intend to show them, so that ads can be shown with zero latency when needed. Since ads expire after an hour, you should clear this cache and reload with new ads every hour.

### Autoload mode

If enabled, the ad will automatically load new content when the current ad is dismissed or completed. Additionally, it will automatically retry loading the ad if an error occurs during the loading process.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

rewardedAd.contentCallback = adContentCallback
rewardedAd.isAutoloadEnabled = true
}
```

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    rewardedAd.setContentCallback(adContentCallback);
    rewardedAd.setAutoloadEnabled(true);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

By default autoload disabled.

## Show Ad

When you show a rewarded ad, you will use an `OnRewardEarnedListener` object to handle reward for the user.

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
import com.cleveradssolutions.sdk.screen.OnRewardEarnedListener

rewardedAd.show(this, object : OnRewardEarnedListener {
    override fun onUserEarnedReward(ad: AdContentInfo) {
    // Called when a user earns a reward from the ad.
    // TODO: Reward the user
    }
})
```

```java
import com.cleveradssolutions.sdk.screen.OnRewardEarnedListener;

rewardedAd.show(MyActivity.this, new OnRewardEarnedListener() {  
    @Override  
    public void onUserEarnedReward(@NonNull AdContentInfo ad) {  
        // Called when a user earns a reward from the ad.
        // TODO: Reward the user
    }  
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Starting with CAS SDK version 4.3.0, all ads functions can be safely called from any thread.

### Checking Ad Availability

Use `isLoaded()` to check whether an ad is currently loaded. 

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
if (rewardedAd.isLoaded) {
}
```

```java
if (rewardedAd.isLoaded()) {
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Even if `isLoaded()` returns `true`, it does not guarantee that the ad will be shown successfully — various issues may still prevent it from being displayed. We strongly recommend handling potential display failures via `onAdFailedToShow(error)` callback to ensure a smoother user experience.

By relying on these callbacks, you ensure that your application can react appropriately to real-time conditions, rather than making assumptions based on ad load state at a single point in time.

## Extra fill Interstitial Ad

Controls whether interstitial ads are shown as a fallback when a rewarded video ad has no available fill. Interstitial ads do not require the user to watch the entire ad to completion. However, the `OnRewardEarnedListener` will still be triggered as if the user completed the rewarded video.
This option is enabled by default. You can disable extra fill by following line: 

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
rewardedAd.isExtraFillInterstitialAdEnabled = false
```

```java
rewardedAd.setExtraFillInterstitialAdEnabled(false);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Mute Ad sounds

Indicates if the application’s audio is muted. Affects initial mute state for all ads.
Use this method only if your application has its own volume controls. 

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
CAS.settings.mutedAdSounds = true
```

```java
CAS.getSettings().setMutedAdSounds(true);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Release ad resource

It is important to `destroy()` loaded but not displayed ads. 

<CodeGroup synchronize="true">
```kotlin
override fun onDestroy() {
    rewardedAd.destroy()
    super.onDestroy()
}
```

```java
@Override  
protected void onDestroy() {  
    rewardedAd.destroy();  
    super.onDestroy();  
}
```
</CodeGroup>
