## Advertising requirements
- Native ads smaller than 32x32dp won't serve. Ads this small can be difficult to see or interact with and may adversely affect the display quality of advertiser assets.
- For native video ads, the main asset `mediaView` must be at least 120x120dp. Video ads won't serve to implementations with main asset `CASMediaViews`smaller than 120dp in any dimension.
- The Ad View must be visible and non-transparent.
- At a single point in time, a loaded ad can only be served in one View. Simultaneous display of a single ad in multiple Views may result in the loss of impression.
- The app must be active (not running in the background).
- Don't edit the text content of assets.
- Don't edit the content of images.

### Media Content
You're required to use the `CASMediaView` asset instead of the `ImageView` asset if you want to include a main image asset in the layout for your native ad.  
The `CASMediaView` is a special `View` designed to display the main media asset, either video or image. Can be defined in an XML layout or constructed dynamically. It should be placed within the view hierarchy of a `CASNativeView`, just like any other asset view.  The media view will be populated automatically when calling `setNativeAd()`.
- Check if the video asset is available using `nativeAd.hasVideoContent`.
- Check if the image asset is available using `nativeAd.hasImageContent`.
- Obtain the recommended aspect ratio of the media content using `nativeAd.getMediaContentAspectRatio`.

### Ad attribution
You must clearly display the text "Ad", "Advertisement", or "Sponsored" (localized appropriately). The badge is required to be a minimum of 15px height and width. Ad attribution must be displayed at the top of the ad.

### AdChoices overlay
Ad AdChoices overlay logo must be displayed at the top of the ad 
Each ad view must display an AdChoices overlay logo. Also, it's important that the AdChoices overlay be easily seen, so choose background colors and images appropriately.

#### Use AdChoices placements
An AdChoices overlay can be added by the SDK if `CASNativeView.adChoicesView` not registered. Leave space in your preferred corner of your native ad view for the automatically inserted AdChoices logo.  
Use `AdChoicesPlacement` constants to set preferred corner. 
```java
adLoader.setAdChoicesPlacement(AdChoicesPlacement.TOP_RIGHT);
```
By default the AdChoices icon position is set to the top right.

#### Use custom AdChoices view
The AdChoices custom view feature lets you position the AdChoices icon in a custom location. This is different from AdChoices position controls, which only allows specification of one of the four corners.  
The following example demonstrates how to set a custom AdChoices view, with the AdChoices icon rendered inside the `CASChoicesView`.
```java
adView.setAdChoicesView((CASChoicesView) adView.findViewById(R.id.ad_choices_view));
```

<Info>
Google Ads does not support `adView.setAdChoicesView`. Instead, specify the desired `AdChoicesPlacement` for the logo. Other ad sources will display their logo in your custom view.

### Star Rating view
The rating from 0.0-5.0 that represents the average rating of the app in a store.
#### Use template view with auto populate rating value
Add `CASStarRatingView` to view hierarchy and CAS SDK populate rating value for you.
```java
CASStarRatingView starRatingView = (CASStarRatingView) adView.findViewById(R.id.ad_star_rating);
// Optionaly change space and color
starRatingView.setSpace(spaceInPixels);
starRatingView.setColor(Color.parseColor("#4285F4"));

adView.setStarRatingView(starRatingView);
```

#### Use custom view with auto populate rating value 
Implement `NativeAdStarRating` interface in your custom view.
```java
class CustomRatingView extends View implements NativeAdStarRating {
    @Nullable  
    @Override  
    public Double getRating() {  
        return 5.0;  
    }  
      
    @Override  
    public void setRating(@Nullable Double aDouble) {  
        // Update star rating view
    }
}

adView.setStarRatingView((CustomRatingView) adView.findViewById(R.id.ad_star_rating));
```

#### Use custom view with manual populate rating value
You need populate `nativeAd.starRating` value to custom view, for example `RatingBar` view:
```java
RatingBar customRatingView = (RatingBar) adView.findViewById(R.id.ad_star_rating);
customRatingView.setNumStars(5);
customRatingView.setStepSize(0.5f);

Double rating = nativeAd.getStarRating();
if (rating != null) {
    customRatingView.setRating(rating);
}

adView.setStarRatingView(customRatingView);
```
