<Warning>
This document is intended only for internal debugging of applications in release.
</Warning>

Android Debug Bridge (`adb`) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device.  
`adb` is included in the Android SDK Platform Tools package. Download this package with the [SDK Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#sdk-manager), which installs it at `android_sdk/platform-tools/`. If you want the standalone Android SDK Platform Tools package, [download it here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).

## Query for devices
[Enable adb debugging on your device](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb#Enabling) and connect the device over USB.

Before issuing `adb` commands, it is helpful to know what device instances are connected to the `adb` server. Generate a list of attached devices using the `devices` command:
```
adb devices
```

## Enable CAS Debugging
To enable debug mode for all applications using the CAS.AI SDK on a connected device, use the following command. This mode is required for other debug bridge commands and activates all SDK logs. 

```bash
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.enabled 1
```

To disable debug mode, use the following command:
```bash
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.enabled .
```

<Info>
The debugging features will remain active until you disable them manually or restart the device.
</Info>

## Filter Active Ad Sources
You can manage the active ad sources using the whitelist and blacklist properties. Enter one or more adapter names separated by commas without spaces.

To specify a whitelist of source adapters for processing:
```bash
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.whitelist AdMob,Kidoz
```

To specify a blacklist of source adapters to filter out from processing:
```bash
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.filter AdMob,Kidoz
```

<Info>
Make sure you clear the filters after testing to activate the full list of sources for proper operation of the SDK.
</Info>

To clear the whitelist and blacklist, use the following commands:
```bash
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.whitelist .
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.filter .
```


## Switch to Test Ads mode
Switch all ad impressions to CAS Test Ads.
```
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.testmode 1
```

<Info>Introduced with CAS 4.1.2.</Info>

## Open Test Suite
To open a selected test suite upon application launch, use the command below. Supported values include 'cas', 'max', and 'is'.

Open Test Suite command:
```bash
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.testsuit cas
```

To clear the selected test suite, use:
```bash
adb shell setprop debug.clever.ads.solutions.testsuit .
```
