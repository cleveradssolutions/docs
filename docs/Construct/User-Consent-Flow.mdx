title: User Consent Flow
---

<Info>
It is optional to use the CMP flow included with the CAS SDK. If you integrate your own CMP flow, make sure that flow completes before you initialize the CAS SDK.
</Info>

<Info>
If you implement a CMP that is compliant with IAB TCF v2 ([Transparency & Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf-2-0/)) for your user consent flow, the CAS SDK supports sending the TCF v2 consent to networks. In this case, the CAS Consent Flow will not be shown to the user.
</Info>

In order for CAS and our ad providers to deliver ads that are more relevant to your users, as a mobile app publisher, you need to collect explicit user consent for use of personal data in the regions covered by GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PIPEDA.

### 1. Opt-in consent for the collection and use of personal data in the regions covered by GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PIPEDA.
Any businesses established are required to comply with GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, LGPD in Brazil, PIPEDA in Canada or risk facing heavy fines.

Keep in mind that it’s best to contact qualified legal professionals, if you haven’t done so already, to get more information and be well-prepared for compliance.

#### Users will not see the Consent dialog if at least one of following is true
* Users located in regions that are not covered by information protection
* Users who are subject to COPPA restrictions.

### 2. Asking user permission to track them or access their device’s advertising identifier
With iOS 14.5 and later, you need to receive the user’s permission through the `AppTrackingTransparency` framework in order to track them or access their device’s advertising identifier.  Read more about Asking Permission to Track and AppTrackingTransparency Framework on [Apple developer page](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/)

<Warning>  
If an app does not present this request, the IDFA will automatically be zeroed out, which may lead to a significant loss in ad revenue.
</Warning>

#### Users will not see the ATT request if at least one of the following is true
* Users using iOS versions below 14.5
* Users who have indicated that they do not allow apps to ask to track them, by setting *Settings > Privacy, Allow Apps to Request to Track*
* Users with child accounts, or who are under age 18, who are signed in via their Apple ID
* Users who have already answered so far
* The app does not have a usage tracking description in `IOS_USER_TRACKING_USAGE` variable.

## Automatic consent flow
The automatic consent flow is enabled by default and described on the [Automation options page](Construct/Automation-Options).

## Conditions
- On Consent Form Dismissed: Triggered when the consent form is dismissed after CAS initialization or manual consent form show.
- On Consent Required: Triggered when user consent is required  after CAS initialization or manual consent form show.
- On Consent Not Required: Triggered when user consent is not required after CAS initialization or manual consent flow show.
- Is Consent Required: Checks if user consent is required.

## Manual consent flow
Perform `Show Consent Form` action to show the built-in consent form manually. If the consent is required, the SDK loads the form and immediately presents it.

<Property name="If required only" type="boolean">
Shows the consent form only if it is required and the user has not responded previously.
</Property>

## Consent Status

</Warning>

## User Country Code
Gets the user's country ISO 2 code based on their IP address. For example: `'US'` or `'--'` if unknown.

## Privacy options button
Some consent forms require the user to modify their consent at any time. Adhere to the following steps to implement a privacy options button if required.

<Steps>
<Step>
Implement a UI element, such as a button in your app's settings page, that can trigger a privacy options form.

</Step>
