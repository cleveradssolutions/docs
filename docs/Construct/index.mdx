Select created object to configure CAS.AI plugin.

Some required configuration steps for your project will be performed automatically using the CAS Gradle plugin for Android and the CAS Ruby script for iOS. You need to register your app on the https://cas.ai platform using the bundle package name for Android and the iTunes ID for iOS.
- For Android the bundle package name will be detected automatically.
- **For iOS you must specify the registered iTunes ID** in the `CAS Id (iTunes Id)` plugin properties. If you do not provide your iTunes ID, the ads in your app will be replaced with test ads.

<Accordion title="What is CAS ID in iOS?">

In most cases, a CASID is the same as your app store ID.  
You can find an app store ID in the URL of your app’s Apple App Store URL. For example, the URL is `apps.apple.com/us/app/id123456789` then app store ID is `123456789`.

## Mediated Networks
CAS.AI SDK offers three integration paths. Choose one based on your app’s target audience.
If you're unsure which solution best fits your application, please contact your account manager.

<Tabs groupId="platform">
<TabItem label="Android" value="android">

## Advertising Identifier
CAS Mediation uses the [Google Advertising ID](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en) and [Apple Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport) to deliver personalized and more relevant ads to each user.  
To enable the use of the Advertising ID in your app, you need to complete the following setup steps.

<Tabs groupId="platform">
<TabItem label="Android" value="android">
CAS Mediation allows you to easily enable or disable (`true` or `false`) the use of the Advertising ID, depending on your app’s privacy requirements.

- Android Integration  
  Use Ad ID: `true`


An application must not use an advertising identifier if **at least one** of the following conditions is true:
- The app’s target audience includes **only children**, as defined in the [Families Policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335?sjid=10683822576513227860-EU).
- The app is being built for **devices that do not use Google Play Services** (e.g. Amazon or Huawei devices).

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="iOS" value="ios">
To use the [App Tracking Transparency authorization request](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsusertrackingusagedescription) for accessing the IDFA, add plugin variable `IOS_USER_TRACKING_USAGE` to the `config.xml` with a custom message describing your usage. Below is an example description text:

- iOS Integration  
  Tracking Usage Description: `Your data will remain confidential and will only be used to provide you a better and personalised ad experience`
