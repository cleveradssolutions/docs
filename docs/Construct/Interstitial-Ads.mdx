title: Interstitial Ads
description: This guide explains how to integrate interstitial ads into a Construct app.
---

Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the interface of their host app.
They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between screens.
When an app shows an interstitial ad, the user has the choice to either tap on the ad and continue to its destination or close it and return to the app.


## Load Interstitial ad
Loads an Interstitial ad. This action works asynchronously, and you can use the `Wait for previous actions to complete` action to wait until the ad has been loaded or failed to load.

When autoload is enabled, a new ad will be automatically loaded after each display, and loading failures will trigger automatic retry attempts.

Ad content may take some time to load after creating an ad instance.
To ensure the ad displays instantly when needed, load the ad instance in advance.

### Conditions
- On Interstitial Ad Loaded: Triggered when an Interstitial ad is successfully loaded.
- On Interstitial Ad Failed to Load: Triggered when an Interstitial ad fails to load.
- Is Interstitial Ad Loaded: Checks if an Interstitial ad is loaded.


## Show Interstitial ad
Interstitial ads should be displayed during natural pauses in the flow of an app. Between app screens is a good example, or after the user completes a task.

This action works asynchronously, and you can use the `Wait for previous actions to complete` action to wait until the ad has been dismissed or failed to show.

### Conditions
- On Interstitial Ad Failed to Show: Triggered when an Interstitial ad fails to show.
- On Interstitial Ad Showed: Triggered when an Interstitial ad is shown.
- On Interstitial Ad Clicked: Triggered when an Interstitial ad is clicked.
- On Interstitial Ad Dismissed: Triggered when an Interstitial ad is dismissed.

There is no need to check whether the ad is loaded before showing it. If the ad is not ready at that moment, the `On ad failed to show` condition will be triggered.

<Info>
When an error occurs during ad impression, only the `On ad failed to show` condition is triggered.  
In this case, the `On ad dismissed` condition will not be fired since the impression is not considered successful.

## Destroy Interstitial ad
Destroys the Interstitial ad instance and frees up resources. To resume working with ads, use the load ad action.

## Some best practices

#### Consider whether interstitial ads are the right type of ad for your app.

Interstitial ads work best in apps with natural transition points. The conclusion of a task within an app, like sharing an image or completing a game level, creates such a point. Because the user is expecting a break in the action, it's easy to present an interstitial ad without disrupting their experience. Make sure you consider at which points in your app's workflow you'll display interstitial ads and how the user is likely to respond.

#### Remember to pause the action when displaying an interstitial ad.

There are a number of different types of interstitial ads: text, image, video, and more. It's important to make sure that when your app displays an interstitial ad, it also suspends its use of some resources to allow the ad to take advantage of them. For example, when you make the call to display an interstitial ad, be sure to pause any audio output being produced by your app.

#### Allow for adequate loading time.

Just as it's important to make sure you display interstitial ads at an appropriate time, it's also important to make sure the user doesn't have to wait for them to load. Loading the ad in advance by calling `load` before you intend to call `show` can ensure that your app has a fully loaded interstitial ad at the ready when the time comes to display one.

#### Don't flood the user with ads.

While increasing the frequency of interstitial ads in your app might seem like a great way to increase revenue, it can also degrade the user experience and lower clickthrough rates. Make sure that users aren't so frequently interrupted that they're no longer able to enjoy the use of your app.
