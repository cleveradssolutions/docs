title: Targeting options
---

You can now easily tailor the way you serve your ads to fit a specific audience!
You’ll need to inform our servers of the users’ details so the SDK will know to serve ads according
to the segment the user belongs to.

### User Age
Set user age. Limitation: 1-99. By default 0 is 'unknown'.

```js
casai.setUserAge(12);
```

### User Gender

Set targeting to user’s gender. Limitation: `'male'`, `'female'`, `undefined`.

```js
casai.setUserGender('male');
``` 

### User Location auto collection
Collect from the device the latitude and longitude coordinated truncated to the hundredths decimal place.

* Collect only if your application already has the relevant end-user permissions.
- Does not collect if the target audience is children.
- Disabled by default.

```js
casai.setLocationCollectionEnabled(true);
```

### App Keywords
Set a list of keywords, interests, or intents related to your application. Words or phrases describe
the current activity of the user for targeting purposes.

```js
casai.setAppKeywords(keywords);
```

### App Content URL

Set the content URL for a website whose content matches the app's primary content. This website content is used for targeting and brand safety purposes. Limitation: max URL length 512.

```js
casai.setAppContentUrl(contentUrl);
```
