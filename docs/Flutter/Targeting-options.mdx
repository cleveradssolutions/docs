title: Targeting options
---

You can now easily tailor the way you serve your ads to fit a specific audience!  
You’ll need to inform our servers of the users’ details so the SDK will know to serve ads according
to the segment the user belongs to.

### User ID
The userID is a unique identifier supplied by your application and must be static for each user across sessions. 
```dart
CASMobileAds.targetingOptions.setUserID("user-hash-code");
```

<Warning>  
Your userID should not contain any personally identifiable information such as  an email address, screen name, Android ID (AID), or Google Advertising ID (GAID).
</Warning>

### User Age
Set user age. Limitation: 1-99. By default 0 is 'unknown'.

 ```dart
CASMobileAds.targetingOptions.setAge(12);
```

### User Gender
Set targeting to user’s gender. Limitation: `unknown, male, female`.

 ```dart
CASMobileAds.targetingOptions.setGender(Gender.male);
```

### User Location
Set the user's current location. Location data is not used to CAS; however, it may be used by third party ad networks.

 ```dart
CASMobileAds.targetingOptions.setLocation(latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude);
```

<Warning>  
Do not use Location just for advertising. Your app should have a valid use case for it as well.
</Warning>

### User Location auto collection
Collect from the device the latitude and longitude coordinated truncated to the hundredths decimal place. 
- Collect only if your application already has the relevant end-user permissions.  
* Does not collect if the target audience is children.   
* Disabled by default.

 ```dart
CASMobileAds.targetingOptions.setLocationCollectionEnabled(true);
```

### App Keywords
Set a list of keywords, interests, or intents related to your application. Words or phrases describe
the current activity of the user for targeting purposes.

 ```dart
CASMobileAds.targetingOptions.setKeywords(keywords);
```

### App Content URL
Set the content URL for a website whose content matches the app's primary content. This website content is used for targeting and brand safety purposes. Limitation: max URL length 512.

 ```dart
CASMobileAds.targetingOptions.setContentUrl(contentUrl);
```
