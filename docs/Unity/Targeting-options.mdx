title: Targeting options
---

You can now easily tailor the way you serve your ads to fit a specific audience!  
You’ll need to inform our servers of the users’ details so the SDK will know to serve ads according
to the segment the user belongs to.

## User Age

Set user age. Limitation: 1-99 and 0 is 'unknown'.

```csharp
CAS.MobileAds.targetingOptions.age = 12;
```

## User Gender

Set user gender.

```csharp
CAS.MobileAds.targetingOptions.gender = Gender.Male;
```

## App Keywords

Set a list of keywords, interests, or intents related to your application. Words or phrases describe
the current activity of the user for targeting purposes.

```csharp
CAS.MobileAds.targetingOptions.SetKeywords(new[] { "words" });
```

## App Content URL

Set the content URL for a website whose content matches the app's primary content. This website
content is used for targeting and brand safety purposes. Limitation: max URL length 512.

```csharp
CAS.MobileAds.targetingOptions.contentUrl = contentUrl;
```

## Track Location Enabled
Collect from the device the latitude and longitude coordinated truncated to the hundredths decimal place. Collect only if your application already has the relevant end-user permissions. Does not collect if the target audience is children.

By default selected in `Assets > CleverAdsSolutions > iOS Settings > Other Settings` menu:
- [x] Location targeting if allowed

Change the flag at any time using the following method:
```csharp
CAS.MobileAds.targetingOptions.locationCollectionEnabled = true;
```
