## Verbose Debug logging
The enabled Debug Mode will display a lot of useful information for debugging about the states of the SDK with tag `CAS.AI`.  
Disabled by default. Disabling Debug Mode may improve application performance.  
You can enable logging in `Assets > CleverAdsSolutions > Settings` menu or change the flag at any time using the following method:
```cs
CAS.MobileAds.settings.isDebugMode = enabled;
```

If you have discovered the problem in the work of the SDK, please provide us with a description of the problem along with the full log of your device.

## Loading mode
Managing ad availability is not easy. Keeping a balance between maximum ad availability while minimizing waste (network calls - which may affect user experience and data usage - and calls to mediated networks APIs - which may negatively impact eCPM if their inventory never gets to be shown to a user) can turn out to be harder than expected. In fact, often, it is simply guess work as you cannot predict ahead of time when a user will reach a moment in your application or game where it makes sense to show an Interstitial or offer the possibility to watch a Rewarded ad.

When you try to time your ad requests, this often results in not having a fill when you need it or having wasted fills that are never shown.  

<Info>
The CAS SDK provides an “auto-request” feature to address this problem.   
By default, CAS SDK starts with auto-request enabled for all managers.  
</Info>

This means two things:
- When a user finishes watching an ad, CAS immediately tries to replace that ad.
- When a certain placement has trouble obtaining a fill (no traditional mediated network has available inventory and no programmatic demand is bidding within a predetermined amount of time), CAS continues trying to ensure that placement gets a fill by restarting the entire ad request process. This is performed in exponentially increasing time intervals to optimize the chances of getting a fill while minimizing usage of device resources.  

However, you can choose to disable auto-request when you set `Manual` loading mode.

Change the Waterfall loading mode using the following method:
```c#
CAS.MobileAds.settings.loadingMode = mode;
```

## Auto check for CAS updates
CAS check for new versions of the unity plugin when opening the settings window. If a new version is found then you will be prompted to update the plugin.  
You can disable the auto check update and use the `Check for Updated` button at the top of the settings window.

You can set this option using the `Assets > CleverAdsSolutions > Settings > Other Settings`  window.
