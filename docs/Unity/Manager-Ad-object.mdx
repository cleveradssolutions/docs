title: Manager Ad object
---

To display ads, you must initialize the mediation manager with a unique Manager ID.   
This needs to be done only once for each manager, ideally on first scene.  

1. Add an GameObject to your scene using `GameObject > Create Empty` in the Unity Editor.
2. Add Component `CleverAdsSolutions/Initialize Manager Ad Object` in the inspector to new GameObject.
3. Select [Manager ID](Unity/Configuring-SDK#manager-ids) from settings asset for each runtime platform.  
4. Invoke a `Initialize()` method to begin initialization.

- **Initialize On Awake**  
Automatically invoke the `Initialize()` method when the component is awake.
 - **Consent Flow Enabled**  
 Use Consent Flow in ads initialization.
  - **Consent Flow**  
   If desired, select an ConsentFlow Ad Object for additional options or leave it blank.
- **Meta Audience Network Privacy**  
Read more about [Additional Meta AudienceNetwork steps](Unity/Additional-Meta-AudienceNetwork-steps).
- **OnInitialized**  
The Unity event will be invoked when the Mediation Manager is initialized and ready.
- **OnInitializationFailed**  
The Unity event will be invoked when the Mediation Manager initialization failed.  
Wait for the OnInitialized event to call the manager.
