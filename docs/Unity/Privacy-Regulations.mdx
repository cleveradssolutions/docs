CleverAdsSolutions requires you to set flags indicating whether users are in an age-restricted category.

## Prohibition on Personal Information from Children
Publishers may designate all inventory within their applications as being child-directed or as COPPA-applicable though our UI. Publishers who have knowledge of specific individuals as being COPPA-applicable should make use of the API discussed below to inform CAS and all downstream consumers of this information.

### Audience.Children
If you know that the user falls within an age-restricted category (i.e., under the age of 16), you must set the `Children` audience flag:
```csharp
CAS.MobileAds.settings.taggedAudience = Audience.Children;
```
It also allows application to comply with the Google Play Families Policy requirements:
 - Ads displayed to those users do not involve interest-based advertising or remarketing;
 - Ads displayed to those users present content that is appropriate for children;
 - Ads displayed to those users follow the Families ad format requirements;
 - Compliance with all applicable legal regulations and industry standards relating to advertising to children.
 
### Audience.NotChildren
If you know that the user does not fall within an age-restricted category, you must set the `NotChildren` audience flag:
```csharp
CAS.MobileAds.settings.taggedAudience = Audience.NotChildren;
```

### Audience.Mixed
The user's age has not been determined.
```c#
CAS.MobileAds.settings.taggedAudience = Audience.Mixed;
```
If your app's target age groups include both children and older audiences, any ads that may be shown to children must comply with Google Play's Families Ads Program.  
A neutral age screen must be implemented so that any ads not suitable for children are only shown to older audiences.  
A neutral age screen is a mechanism to verify a user's age in a way that doesn't encourage them to falsify their age and gain access to areas of your app that aren't designed for children, for example, an age gate.
