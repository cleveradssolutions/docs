## Add the External Dependency Manager for Unity

This library is intended for use by any Unity plugin that requires access to Android specific libraries (e.g., AARs) or iOS CocoaPods. It provides Unity plugins the ability to declare dependencies, which are then automatically resolved and copied into your Unity project.
1. Download latest [external-dependency-manager.unitypackage](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver/blob/master/external-dependency-manager-latest.unitypackage).
2. In your open Unity project, navigate to `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package`.
