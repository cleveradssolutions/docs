## Manager Ids
In most cases, a CAS Manager Id is the same as the Android App's package name, and the iOS App's store Id.
- A [package name](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id) uniquely identifies your app on the device and in the Google Play Store.
- The store ID of an iOS app uniquely identifies your app in the Apple App Store.
- You can find an app's store ID in the URL of your appâ€™s Apple App Store listing. For example, the URL of an app page is `apps.apple.com/us/app/id123456789`. The app's store ID is `123456789`.
-  If you haven't created an CAS account and registered an app yet, now's a great time to do so at [CAS.ai](https://cas.ai). 
- In a real app, it is important that you use your actual CAS manager ID.

## Cross-promotion
Cross-promotion is an app marketing strategy in which app developers promote one of their titles on another one of their titles. Cross promoting is especially effective for developers with large portfolios of games as a means to move users across titles and use the opportunity to scale each of their apps. This is most commonly used by hyper-casual publishers who have relatively low retention, and use cross promotion to keep users within their app portfolio.  

Start your cross promotion campaign with CAS [here](https://cas.ai).
