title: Rewarded Ads
---


Rewarded ads are ads that users have the option of interacting with in exchange for in-app rewards. 

This guide shows you how to integrate rewarded ads into a Unity app.  

Enable Rewarded Ads for your game in `Assets > CleverAdsSolutions > Settings` menu:

> ❕For easier ads integration using the Unity Editor, try the new [RewardedAdObject](Unity/Rewarded-Ad-object).

## Ad events
To further customize the behavior of your ad, you can hook into a number of events in the ad's lifecycle: loading, opening, closing, and so on. Listen for these events by registering a delegate for the appropriate event, as shown below.


```csharp
manager.OnRewardedAdCompleted += AdCompleted;
manager.OnRewardedAdLoaded += AdLoaded;
manager.OnRewardedAdFailedToLoad += AdFailedToLoad;
manager.OnRewardedAdShown += AdShown;
manager.OnRewardedAdFailedToShow += AdFailedToShow;
manager.OnRewardedAdClicked += AdClicked;
manager.OnRewardedAdClosed += AdClosed;

void AdCompleted()
{
    Debug.Log("The user earned the reward.")
}
void AdLoaded()
{
    Debug.Log("Rewarded ad loaded");
}
void AdFailedToLoad(AdError error)
{
    Debug.Log("Rewarded failed to load an ad with error: " + error.GetMessage());
}
void AdShown()
{
    Debug.Log("Rewarded ad full screen content opened");
}
void AdFailedToShow(string error)
{
    Debug.LogError("Rewarded ad failed to open full screen content: " + error);
}
void AdClicked()
{
    Debug.Log("Rewarded ad was clicked");
}
void AdClosed()
{
    Debug.Log("Rewarded ad full screen content closed");
}
```

<Info>
When an error occurs during ad impression, executed the `OnRewardedAdFailedToShow` only.  In this case the `OnRewardedAdClosed` will not be executed, since the impression is not considered successful.
</Info>

Read more about event `OnRewardedAdImpression` with [Impression Level Data](Unity/Impression-Level-Data) and `AdMetaData`.  
## Load an Ad
By default, the **auto-load ads mode is used** and a load method does not need to be called.  
Call manual load ad before each show if you use `LoadingManagerMode.Manual` only.  

Use `AdType.Rewarded` parameter for load ad:
```csharp
manager.LoadAd(AdType.Rewarded);
```

## Check the ad availability
You can ask for the ad availability directly by calling the following function:
```cs
bool adLoaded = manager.IsReadyAd(AdType.Rewarded);
```

Avoid using `IsReadyAd` every frame in `Update` or `Coroutine`; instead, subscribe to the `OnRewardedAdLoaded` event. This method call the native SDK and can affect the performance of your game. 

You don't have to check `IsReadyAd` before showing an ad; instead, subscribe to the `OnRewardedAdFailedToShow` event, which will be triggered if the ad isn't ready to show.

## Show the Ad
Before displaying a rewarded ad to users, you must present the user with an explicit choice to view rewarded ad content in exchange for a reward. Rewarded ads must always be an opt-in experience.  

Subscribe to `OnRewardedAdCompleted` event to reward the user.

Use `AdType.Rewarded` parameter to show ad:
```cs
manager.ShowAd(AdType.Rewarded);
```

## Muted Ads Sounds
Sounds in Interstitial and Rewarded ads mute state. Disabled by default.  
```cs
CAS.MobileAds.settings.isMutedAdSounds = mute;
```

## Allow Interstitial ads
Sometimes a situation occurs when filling Rewarded ads is not enough, in this case, you can allow the display of Interstitial ads to receiving a reward in any case.  
This option will compare ad cost and serve regular interstitial ads when rewarded video ads are expected to generate less revenue.  
Interstitial Ads does not require to watch the video to the end, but the `OnRewardedAdCompleted` event will be invoked in any case.  
Enabled by default.

Change the flag at any time using the following method:
```c#
CAS.MobileAds.settings.allowInterstitialAdsWhenVideoCostAreLower = allow;
```
